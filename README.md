# **Bugs**

- Problem : The home page option is missing from the drop-down menu in the tablet mode. 
- Cause : The styling padding was causing the top of the list to be obscured.
- Resolution :  The padding was adjusted.

- Problem : Fails to load. 
- Cause : Removed surplus apps cause a process error.
- Resolution :  Removing links/migrations to previous apps.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Unresolved Issues
- Items can be increased beyond the 99 limit in the shopping bag, this would have to additional code before going live.
- When Donations are purchased and the total shopping bag is less then Â£50 a delivery is added, this too would require further coding before going live.
- When DEBUG is set to False media fails to load - media remains from cached from a previous True. Further investigation and coding is required to resolve this.  

# **Deployment**

The site can be deployed locally using VsCode IDE, deployed on Heroku using Amazon W3 for the the hosting of static and media files. The site will automatically update with commits to the main branch, the code will contiue to run locally. A temporary issue has arised with automatic deployment from commits due a breach with heroku this is currently being investigated and be resolved. 

## Deployment Requirements

- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) with VsCode - Local development tool
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Documentation is based on Python v3.8
- [PIP3] PIP package installer 
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) Payment infrastructure
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/) Media Storage
- [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/) Cloud Platform


## Deploying Locally

1. In the repository click on the "use this template" it will open in a new window with you being required to give the new repository a name. Select public or private and then the create button.
2. When the new repository has been created select Gitpod to open.
3. When this completes you will be required to import the requirememts using the following;

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pip3 install -r requirements.txt

5. Within the root dir called env.py, in this file add the following lines to set up the environmental variables.

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;import os

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "[Your Secret Key]"
 
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;os.environ["DEV"] = "1"
 
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;os.environ["HOSTNAME"] = "0.0.0.0"
 
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "[Your Stripe Key]"
 
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "[Your Stripe Secret Key]"
 
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "[Your DB URL]"

### Database

1. To set up your database you will first need to run the following command.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;python3 manage.py migrate

3. To create a super user to allow you to access the admin panel run the following command in your terminal and complete the required information as prompted.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;python3 manage.py createsuperuser

4. From there you should now be able to run the server using the following command.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;python3 manage.py runserver

5. Next close the server in your terminal using ctrl+c (cmd+c on mac) and run the following commands to populate the database.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;python3 manage.py loaddata store/fixtures/categories.json

## Deploying To Heroku

To run this application in an online environment you will need to deploy the code to Heroku. Before moving on to this section please ensure you have followed the instructions for local deployment and this has been successful

1.	Either create an account at [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/) or log in to your account.
2.	Set up a new app under a unique name.
3.	In the resources section, in the addons field type the below command and select the free cost option.

###### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;heroku Postgres

4.	in the settings tab select Reveal Config Vars and copy the pre populated DATABASE_URL into your settings.py file in your project.
5.	in the Config Vars in Heroku you will need to populate with the following keys.

##### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Key&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Value

###### &emsp;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;DATABASE_URL&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;EMAIL_HOST_PASS&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;EMAIL_HOST_USER&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;SECRET_KEY&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;STRIPE_SECRET_KEY&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;STRIPE_WH_SECRET&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[your value]

###### &emsp;USE_AWS&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TRUE

6.	Now this has been configured you will now migrate the local database to the cloud database using the migrate command as below.

###### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;python3 manage.py migrate

7.	Next you will need to create a super user and populate the database as described in the database set up section.
8.	From here, select the Github option and connect the repository from GitHub and select the branch (Master) to deploy from, the migrations and data has been       loaded, in your Heroku dashboard select the Deploy tab.
9.	It is advised to select automatic deployment to ensure for each push to Github the hosted version is up to date(Currently the manual process is being used as Heroku is experiencing security issues)*.
10.	When this has deployed select open app from the top bar of the Heroku App.

Heroku Manual Process (the automatic had been set up before the issue)

IF YOU ARE CREATING A NEW DEPLOYMENT/APP

-	Run the command heroku login -i and login when prompted. Then run the command heroku create your_app_name_here to create a new app, replacing your_app_name_here with the name you want to give your app. This will create a new Heroku app and link it to your Gitpod terminal. You can then access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN APP CREATED WHICH USES AUTOMATIC DEPLOYS
-	Run the command heroku login -i and login when prompted. Then run the following command: heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
-	Followed by git push heroku main
